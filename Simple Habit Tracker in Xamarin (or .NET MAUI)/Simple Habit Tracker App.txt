3. Mobile Development with Xamarin (or .NET MAUI)
Workload: Mobile Development with .NET
Language: C#

Project Idea: Simple Habit Tracker App
A habit tracker app is a great way to demonstrate mobile development skills. Itâ€™s simple but involves working with mobile-specific features.

Features:

Track daily habits (e.g., exercise, reading).
View progress with a calendar or chart.
Set reminders or notifications for habits.
Sync data to a cloud service (like Firebase or Azure).
Libraries:

Xamarin.Essentials: For accessing native device features (like notifications).
SQLite-net: For local data storage.
SkiaSharp: For custom drawing (like charts or progress bars).
Project Breakdown:

UI Design: Use XAML to design the mobile app interface. Focus on creating a clean, user-friendly design.
Data Management: Store habits and tracking data locally using SQLite.
Notifications: Use Xamarin.Essentials to trigger reminders for habits.
Optional Enhancements: Add cloud syncing for cross-device support.
