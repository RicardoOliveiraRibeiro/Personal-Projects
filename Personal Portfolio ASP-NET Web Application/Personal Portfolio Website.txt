Project Idea: Personal Portfolio Website
A personal portfolio website is not only a great learning project but also something you can host and show to potential employers.

Features:

Home page with an introduction and a summary of your skills.
A projects page to showcase all the projects (including the one weâ€™re building now!).
A contact form that sends emails to your address.
Blog section where you can write posts about your learning journey.
Libraries:

Entity Framework Core: For managing a database to store your blog posts and project details.
Bootstrap: For responsive design (you can use a NuGet package or link to the CDN).
MailKit: For handling the email functionality from the contact form.
Project Breakdown:

Frontend: Use Razor Pages or MVC for generating the HTML. Add some CSS (with Bootstrap) to make it look good.
Backend: Implement a simple CRUD system for blog posts using Entity Framework Core. Set up controllers to handle requests.
Database: Use SQLite or SQL Server for storing your data.
Deployment: Host the website on Azure or another hosting service.
