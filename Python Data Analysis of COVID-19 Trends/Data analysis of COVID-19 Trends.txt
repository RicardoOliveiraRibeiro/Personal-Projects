Workload: Data Science and Analytical Applications
Language: Python

Project Idea: Data Analysis of COVID-19 Trends
Analyze public COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends and create visualizations.

Features:

Load and clean data from a CSV file.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
Generate visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.
Optionally, apply machine learning to predict future trends.
Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning (if you want to take it further).
Project Breakdown:

Data Loading: Use Pandas to read data from public datasets.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, filter data, etc.
Visualization: Create meaningful visualizations to present your findings.
Optional Enhancements: Predict trends using linear regression or other simple models.
