1. .NET Console Application (C#)
Workload: .NET Desktop Development
Language: C#

Project Idea: Command-Line Todo List Application
A command-line Todo List application is a great starting project. It’s simple, yet it allows you to demonstrate your understanding of key concepts like input/output, data storage, and basic algorithms.

Features:

Add, remove, and list todo items.
Mark items as complete or incomplete.
Save todo items to a file (to persist data between sessions).
Optionally, add tags or due dates to items.
Libraries:

Newtonsoft.Json: For saving the todo list as a JSON file. It’s a very common library in .NET for handling JSON data.
System.IO: For handling file operations to read and write the todo list to the filesystem.
Project Breakdown:

User Interface: Since it’s a console app, the UI will be text-based. Simple menus and prompts will guide the user.
Data Structure: Use a List<T> to store the todo items, where T is a class representing a Todo item (e.g., with properties for Title, Completed, DueDate, etc.).
Persistence: Implement basic file handling to save and load the todo list from a JSON file. This will introduce you to serialization/deserialization in C#.
Optional Enhancements:
Add sorting or filtering options (e.g., view by due date).
Use regular expressions for advanced parsing of commands (like "add Buy milk due tomorrow").
